        <h2>Luxury car</h2>
        <p>The image shows a top view of a sleek white car with a clean, modern design.
            It features a smooth, aerodynamic body with black-tinted windows and a panoramic
            roof, suggesting a premium and luxury vehicle.The car appears to be a sedan or couple,
            likely mid-sized or large, with a streamlined and elegant appearance. The white exterior
            enhances its sophisticated and minimalist look, while the dark roof and windows accents 
            create a striking contrast. Its overall proportions and attention to detail imply it could
            be a high-end performance-oriented model designed for comfort and style.
